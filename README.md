Project ICy (Internet Computer Yield) was developed by Duke Undergraduate Researchers involved with the summer CS+ programming. ICy is a Decentralized Lending Protocol for the Internet Computer. Similar to Aave, ICy is intended for users to be able to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets without any intermediary involvement.
