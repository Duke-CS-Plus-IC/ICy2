# Introduction to ICy
Project ICy (Internet Computer Yield) was developed by Duke Undergraduate Researchers, Dylan Paul and Malika Rawal, through the Duke CS+ summer programming. 

ICy is a Decentralized Lending Protocol for the Internet Computer. Similar to Aave, ICy is intended for users to be able to lend, borrow, and earn interest on crypto assets without any intermediary involvement. Project ICy uses 6 canisters (Database, Product, Reserves, Treasury, Price Oracle, User A, and User B). Currently, Project ICy can be deployed locally and User A and User B can interact through borrowing and lending. Moreover, an arbitrary user can create an account in the database and keep track of their token and cycle amounts. Users will receive receipts for transactions in terms of ATokens and ACycles that will earn interest. The reserve canister is used to isolate assets and calculate liquidity, and the price oracle canister feeds for the exchange rate of the assets.
